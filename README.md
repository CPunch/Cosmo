# Cosmo
Cosmo is a portable scripting language loosely based off of Lua. Designed for embeddability, Cosmo will have a built-in C++ wrapper for ease of use for embedding in in C++ applications.

# Why Cosmo?
While C++ wrappers for Lua exist (see: SolLua), they're all maintained by outside entitties while Cosmo writes it's own first party wrapper. Additionally, Cosmo is very easily modifiable having been written in clean C99 with well documented code; this makes it a great candidate for early language hackers and researchers alike.

However Cosmo is not just a friendly developer tool, Cosmo's easy syntax and readability makes it a great scripting language for everyone to use.
